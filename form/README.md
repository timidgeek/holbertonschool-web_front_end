# Forms :sparkles:

The purpose of this project is to learn abot HTML forms, which are used to collect user input. This is made possible my the ```<input>``` HTML element, deemed one of the most powerful and complex elements in all of HTML, due to sheer number of combinations of input types and attributes.

## Learning Objectives:
- How to create an HTML5 form
- How to choose the right input type
- How to constrain a form field with regular expressions
- How to style inputs for invalid, valid, and required fields
- How to build a a comment form
- How to build a simple search form
- How to create usable and accessible forms

## General Requirements:
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- A `README.md` at the root of the project directory is mandatory
- HTML and CSS have been rendered on Chrome 78 or more.

## ```<input>``` types:

How an ```<input>``` works varies depending on its type attribute. Below are a few (but not all!) examples for input types:

Type    | Description | Basic Examples
------- | ----------- | --------------
button  | A push button, empty by default | <input type="button" name="button" value="Button">
checkbox | A check box allowing single values to be selected/deselected | <input type="checkbox" name="checkbox">
color | Opens  a color picker | <input type="color" name="color">
file | Lets users select a file | <input type="file" name="file">
range | A range widget | <input type="range" name="range">

## Attributes:

The ```<input>``` element is so powerful because of its attributes; the type attribute, described with examples above, being the most important. Most attributes have an effect on only a specific subset of input types. Below are a few examples for input attributes:

Attribute | Type(s) | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
min | ```date```, ```month```, ```week```, ```time```, ```datetime-local```, ```number```, ```range``` | Minimum value
value | all except ```image``` | The initial value of the control
alt | ```image``` | alt attribute for the image type. Required for accessibility
