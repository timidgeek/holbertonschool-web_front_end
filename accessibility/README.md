# Accessibility :sparkles:
In this project at Holberton School, we will be exploring ways to make online content accessible to people with different disabilities, such as visual and audio impairments. The goal is always to make content that is able to be used by everyone, or as close to everyone as possible. I think it is wonderful to work on a project which covers such an important concept, and can't wait to learn more on how to be an inclusive web developer.

## Learning Objectives:
- ARIAâ€™s main purpose
- WCAG conformance levels (A, AA and AAA)
- The importance of Web Accessibility
- Tools to use for Web Accessibility

## General Requirements:
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- A `README.md` at the root of the project directory is mandatory
