# Sass & Scss :sparkles:
In this project at Holberton, we are exploring a new-to-us program. Sass, or Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets, is a preprocessing program for CSS. It was created to aid the creation of larger and more complex stylesheets. Sass offers new features such as nesting, mixins, and inheritance, which aren't available in CSS.

## Project Learning Objectives:
- What Sass means
- How to write Sass & Scss file
- What is the difference between Sass and Scss
- What is the Sass preprocessing
- How to declare a variable
- How to use nested definition
- How to import a Sass file
- How to use mixins
- How to declare extend/inheritance styles
- How to manipulate operators

## General Requirements:
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `Sass 3.7.4` (or higher)
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your Scss files should have a comment at the beginning (i.e. syntax above)
- All your files should start by a comment describing the task
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
