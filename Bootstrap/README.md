Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains **CSS** and **JavaScript** design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components. In this project we will be using Bootstrap, using only the  CSS styling tools.
